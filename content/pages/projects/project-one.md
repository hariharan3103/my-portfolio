During an internship with **Meck Teck Research Foundation**, I dove into the world of robotics and IoT with two exciting projects: **Obstacle Avoidance Robots** and an **IoT-based Surveillance Robot**.

With tools like **Blynk IoT software**, **Arduino Uno**, **ESP 32**, and **ultrasonic sensors**, I brought these bots to life. What made the experience even more memorable were the interactive sessions and fun conversations with the trainer—it was a perfect blend of learning and laughter!

This project wasn’t just about building robots; it was about discovering the endless possibilities of technology and taking another step toward my dream.
